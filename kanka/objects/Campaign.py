          image_thumb (:obj:`str`): URL to the campaigns image as a thumbnail
          visibility (:obj:`str`): If this is True, other people can see your campaign
          created_at (:obj:`datetime.datetime`): This value returns a datetime object for the time this campaign was
          created.
          updated_at (:obj:`datetime.datetime`):  This value returns a datetime object for the time this campaign was
