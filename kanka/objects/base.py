    Attributes:
        object_id  (:obj:`int`): The id identifying the object against all other objects of the same type. *Note*: id is
         a reserved word in python, we use object_id instead.
        name  (:obj:`str`): The name representing the object.
        entry  (:obj:`str`): The html description of the object.
        image  (:obj:`str`): The local path to the picture of the object.
        image_full  (:obj:`str`): The url to the picture of the object.
        image_thumb (:obj:`str`): The url to the thumbnail of the object.
        is_private  (:obj:`bool`): Determines if the object is only visible by *admin* members of the campaign. If the
        user requesting the API isn't a member of the *admin* role, such objects won't be returned.
        entity_id  (:obj:`int`): The id identifying the objects against all other entities.
        tags  (_List[int]): An array of tags that the object is related to.
        created_at (:obj:`datetime.datetime`): This value returns a datetime object for the time this campaign was
        created_by  (:obj:`int`): The :class:`kanka.objects.User`'s id who created the object.
        updated_at (:obj:`datetime.datetime`):  This value returns a datetime object for the time this campaign was
        last updated.
        updated_by  (:ob:`int`): The :class:`kanka.objects.User`'s id who last updated the object.
